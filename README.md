# Threejs Example Code
This is a repo to hold basic example code of Threejs. I suspect that A-Frame is what you actually want to use to build WebXR applications but since A-Frame itself is a Threejs framework some understanding of how Threejs works might be of value.

### What is Threejs?
- A JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D graphics in the browser
- It uses WebGL (if that is of interest)

### What is A-Frame?
- An entity component system for Threejs
- It's a Unity-like 3D / WebXR development tool compared to pure Threejs which is probably more like with OpenGL directly to create your application
- TLDR: It's what you probably want to use

### Examples Overview:
- 01-spinning-cube: Heavily commented example to show setup of a camera, scene, renderer and display a rotating cubes
- 02-spinning-cube-2: Builds on previous example, adds lighting, two additional cubes, alters renderer code
